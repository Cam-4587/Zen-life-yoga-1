# Features

## Existing Features

### Header and Navigation bar

The header and the navigation bar are located in the middle and at the top of each page that also includes a lily flower that adds to the branding of the yoga studio. The navigation bar is located just underneath the header so that it is easy to find for users and contain navigation links to the other pages. Every page also includes a footer page that has three social media icons that contain navigation links to their respective social media pages. These social media icons are spaced evenly across the center of the footer to make them accessible to users.

### The Home page

The home page includes an 'About us text section' That introduces the user to the yoga studio and what the mission is for the yoga studio. This text is set to the backdrop of a home image of A man in a lotus flower position where the image is translucent allowing the overlaying text to be read more easily by users.

Underneath the About us section is a selection of flip cards that surround a header saying 'Types of yoga that we offer'. The flip cards tell you the type of yoga at the front and then a description of that type of yoga at the back. The flip cards are a hover mechanism so when you hovering the cursor over the card reveals its description and removing the cursor flips the card back over to show its name.

The Gallery page includes 10 images, most of them being images of people performing different yoga positions with a couple of images of equipment that is available at the yoga studio. The images are arranged in a 5*2 grid but when you reduce the screen to a certain width it reduces to a single column of 10 images.
